## Summary

I was fairly unhappy with all existing Jekyll themes for academic webpages so I made a template for others to use. Beginning with the Minimal Mistakes theme, I set up navigation for some pages that are common to academic web pages, made some template pages, added MathJax support, and made quite a few changes to the underlying CSS to adjust the look of the page. The goal was to make a repo that made the website creation process as painless as possible for academics.
