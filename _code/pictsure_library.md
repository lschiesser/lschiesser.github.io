## Summary
PictSure is a deep learning library designed for in-context learning using images and labels. It allows users to provide a set of labeled reference images and then predict labels for new images based on those references, eliminating the need for traditional training and making it highly adaptable for various classification tasks. Importantly, this library is specifically written for and optimized to work with the PictSure model family.
