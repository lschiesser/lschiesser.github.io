For almost 90 years we have expected that the universe has a huge quantity of an invisible form of matter that we have dubbed, dark matter. While we have found more and more convincing evidence that it is there, in the time since, we have learned very little about it. There are currently efforts around the world to attempt to find concrete evidence that dark matter is out there and that the effects that we are seeing are not caused by something else. These include experiments trying to make dark matter, experiments trying to scatter dark matter and experiments looking for the results of dark matter annihilation. In this talk, I will be giving a broad overview of where we stand today in the search for dark matter.
