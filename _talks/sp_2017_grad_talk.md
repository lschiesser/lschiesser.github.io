Cosmologists love to compare independent probes of cosmology to get an increasingly better understanding of the universe as a whole. I am currently working on a model to get the true masses of galaxy cluster by jointly fitting several observables that are thought to trace underlying matter. I will be discussing galaxy clusters, why we care about their masses and what we are doing to find their masses.
