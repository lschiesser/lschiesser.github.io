We measure the scatter in the richness-mass relation for the 30 richest clusters in the redMaPPer catalog for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) using gas mass measurements from the Chandra Xray Observatory. As part of our analysis, we test for the consistency of the mass calibration of the SDSS redMaPPer and Weighing the Giants mass cluster samples. Our results provide the first direct estimate of the scatter in mass of a complete sample of redMaPPer clusters.
