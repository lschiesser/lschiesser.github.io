_Unser Dialögchen über ChatGPT_ (_Our little dialogue about ChatGPT_) is a low barrier event series about large language models like ChatGPT, how they work (on a high level) and their implications in society, education and other sectors. Participants then have the opportunity to discuss with each other and come back to an expert to ask questions, clear up misconceptions and discuss with the expert. As part of this event series we also focused on the educational field cooperating with schools.
