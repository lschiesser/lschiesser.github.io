CRAI _(Center of Research and development of trustworthy AI applications for mid-sized companies)_ is a "real-world laboratory for AI in medium-sized businesses". In its current form it's a pilot project with several partners from industry, research and administration on how to successfully build AI applications compliant with the AI Act. The goal of CRAI is to create an environment where innovative AI solutions can be tested and developed under real-world conditions while ensuring that they comply with the legal requirements set by regulators. This includes not only technical aspects but also ethical considerations such as privacy protection, transparency, accountability, and fairness. <br>
In this project I am involved in developing AI systems in accordance with the AI Act's provisions. I am also interested in developing new methods to comply with legal requirements such as technical documentation, post market surveillance systems, etc.
