The _Green-AI Hub Mittelstand_ is a project funded by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV) to advance the use of AI for sustainbility in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). As part of this project the ministry funds 6-month pilot projects during which two AI experts from DFKI implement an AI system to save material resources like steel, copper and alike. Further, by developing demonstrators and standard applications the Green-AI Hub also shows the potential of AI for sustainability and sustainable economic growth. I am mainly involved in the implementation and realization of the pilot projects where I consult SMEs regarding potential sustainable use cases and then also implement the solutions identified as most promising.
