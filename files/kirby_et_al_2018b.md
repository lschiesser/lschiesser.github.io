excerpt: "We visually classified the morphology of ~200 galaxies in the infall regions of the ESO Distant Clusters Survey catalog (EDisCS) using Hubble Space Telescope images. Using these classifications, we measure how the fraction of each morphology varies as a function of local projected surface density and cluster centric distance to make a statement on the evolution of galaxies as they fall into a cluster from the field."

### Summary
We visually classified the morphology of $\sim 200$ galaxies in the infall regions of the ESO Distant Clusters Survey catalog (EDisCS) using Hubble Space Telescope images. Using these classifications, we measure how the fraction of each morphology varies as a function of local projected surface density and cluster centric distance to make a statement on the evolution of galaxies as they fall into a cluster from the field.
