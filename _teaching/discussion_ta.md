Several of the introductory physics courses at the University of Arizona spend 1 of the lecture slots each week on a dedicated discussion section. During these sessions, the several hundred students that attend the lectures are broken up into section of 20 students to work on problem sets together in discussion sections. Each section is led by a graduate student and has two undergraduate student preceptors. During these sessions, the students work in groups of 4 to complete a packet that is specially designed for group work. The preceptors and myself are walking around the room and ask each groups questions to push them in the right direction when/if they begin to struggle.
