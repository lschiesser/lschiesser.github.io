One of the standard graduate teaching assistant positions at the University of Arizona is to be an instructor for the various undergraduate physics labs. The duties of a lab TA are to oversee two lab sections of about 30 students each week. The lab sections begin with a short introduction to the material that the lab would be covering (typically the lab material was ahead of the course material) and then to assist the students, who work in small groups, to complete the experiment. I have been in charge of labs for several different courses as detailed below.
