## Education
**In Progress**<br>
Ph.D. in Physics<br>

Certificate in College Teaching<br>

## Research experience

**Improving DES Cluster Cosmology via SPT Cluster Observations (2019-Present)**<br>
*Advisor: Eduardo Rozo*<br>
Using the overlapping area of the Dark Energy Survey and South Pole Telescope, I built a complete sample of DES clusters with SPT detections. I then used the sample to constrain the variance in the richness-mass relation and tighten cosmological constraints.

**CLMM Development (2018-Present)**<br>
*LSST DESC*<br>
Co-Leading development of a software package to measure halo mass and bias using weak lensing data from simulations and observations.<br>
*Relevant Publications: Avestruz et al. In Prep*

**Core Cosmology Library Development (2017-2018)**<br>
*LSST DESC*<br>
Standardized physical constants between all of the dependencies of the Core Cosmology Library (CCL). CCL is a software package designed to compute basic cosmological observables to a high degree of accuracy.<br>
*Relevant Publications: <a href="../publications/chisari-et-al-2019" class="uline">Chisari et al. 2019</a>*

**Preprocessing among the Infalling Galaxy Population of EDisCS Clusters (2016-2018)**<br>
*Advisor: Dennis Zaritsky*<br>
Computed redshifts for galaxies in the EDisCS clusters using data taken on a low dispersion spectrograph and then analyzed the colors and clustering properties of confirmed member galaxies.<br>
*Relevant Publications: <a href="../publications/just-et-al-2019" class="uline">Just et al. 2019</a>*

**Improving SDSS Cluster Cosmology via a Modest X-ray Follow-Up Program (2016-2019)**<br>
*Advisor: Eduardo Rozo*<br>
Obtained X-ray mass proxies for the 30 richest galaxy clusters in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and developed a statistical model that I used to tighten cluster cosmology constraints.<br>
*Relevant Publications: <a href="../publications/kirby-et-al-2019a" class="uline">Kirby et al. 2019</a>*<br>

**The Morphological Content of the Infall Regions of EDisCS Clusters (2014-2016)**<br>
*Advisor: Dennis Zaritsky*<br>
Identified cluster member galaxies, led a small group that visually classified the morphology of each cluster member, and analyzed the distribution of morphologies.<br>
*Relevant Publications: Kirby et al. In Prep*

**Measuring Photometric Redshift Bias Due to Unmodeled Dust Reddening (2013-2014)**<br>
*Advisor: Elliot Cheu*<br>
Applied dust absorption models to galaxy spectra to measure the expected photometric redshift bias due to unmodeled galactic dust.

**Evolving Opinions on Social Networks with Competing Committed Groups (2011-2013)**<br>
*Advisor: Gyorgy Korniss*<br>
Simulated and tracked the propagation of opinions on several types of connected social networks with static members using the naming game algorithm.<br>
*Relevant Publications: <a href="../publications/xie-et-al-2012" class="uline">Xie et al. 2012</a>*

## Teaching Experience
**Primary Instructor**<br>

**Lecturer**<br>
*Algebra-Based Mechanics, Fall 2014*<br>
Led lectures including active learning components on algebra-based mechanics. My section was selected to take part in a pilot program to test an innovative collaborative learning space.

**Graduate Teaching Assistant**<br>
*Assorted Courses from 2013-2017*<br>
Algebra-based mechanics for non-science and biology majors. <br>
