I am an AI Researcher currently working at the German Research Institute for Artifical Intelligence (DFKI, Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Künstliche Intelligenz) in the projects Green AI Hub Mittelstand and CRAI. I'm interested in the application of new technologies and paradigms in real life situations and how regulatory frameworks can be integrated successfully in the development and deployment processes of artificial intelligence systems.
